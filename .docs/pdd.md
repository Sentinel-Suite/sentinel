# Project Design Document: Sentinel Suite

**Status:** draft
**Created:** 2026-02-22
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-23

## Problem Statement

Organizations responsible for safety, security, emergency management, emergency planning, and risk management currently rely on fragmented, disconnected tools — or worse, paper and spreadsheets — to manage critical operations. This fragmentation leads to poor incident documentation, slow response times, compliance gaps, increased liability exposure, and inconsistent operations across facilities.

Sentinel Suite is a unified platform designed to serve both contract security companies managing multiple client sites and in-house security departments across a wide range of facility types — from commercial office buildings and hotels/casinos to DOE GOCO-operated National Laboratories.

| ------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Scope creep                     | High     | Strict module-by-module phasing, MVP discipline, clear per-module scope boundaries                     |
| Offline sync complexity         | High     | Early investment in sync architecture, proven patterns (CRDTs or similar), extensive edge-case testing |
| DOE/FISMA compliance complexity | High     | Build compliance into architecture from day one, not bolted on later                                   |
| Funding runway                  | Medium   | Phased delivery to reach revenue-generating state quickly; commercial SaaS first                       |
| Multi-tenancy architecture      | Medium   | Design tiered isolation model upfront; validate with DOE security requirements early                   |
| Solo developer capacity         | Medium   | AI-assisted development, modular architecture enabling future team growth, no hard deadlines           |
